## An Axe for Nergal

### Translation

Nibrutalu, a merchant’s son  
(Lugalsubi his father’s name)  

had someone make an axe of tin  
for Nergal god of mortal end.  

Its wood is from the highest peaks,  
its stone unmatched came from the sky.  

He swings and strikes and wearies not,  
a broken axe I will repair.  

If lost I will replace his blade,  
so may he see me while I live.  

And in the world of death beyond,  
I’d like to drink my water clear.
