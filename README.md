He grows, he grows, he gets so big  
My lettuce leaves he waters well

He holds me in a garden’s shade  
His mother’s joy belongs to me

My furrow’s grain, he’s full of love  
My lettuce leaves he waters well

My apple tree, his tip bears fruit  
My lettuce leaves he waters well

The honey man, the honey man  
He pours his sweetness into me

My lord, my god, the honey man  
His mother’s joy belongs to me

His honey hands, his honey feet  
He pours his sweetness into me

His honey limbs are o so sweet  
He pours his sweetness into me

His navel circles mine so sweet  
His mother’s joy belongs to me

With joyous thighs he covers me  
My lettuce leaves he waters well
