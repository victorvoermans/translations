### Commentary

1\. The ‘growing’ refers to Dumuzi as vegetation, and, in this erotic context, to his erection. The ‘lettuce’ is Inana’s vulva, which is ‘watered’ by Dumuzi. The verb is perfective, perhaps because it is a ‘timeless truth’.  

3\. Another sexual image: ‘barley’ for penis, ‘furrow’ for vagina.

4\. The meaning of **niĝ₂ saĝ-ĝa₂** is not entirely clear to me. Perhaps it would be normally said of apple trees to be of ‘top quality’ in this way, but I think in this context it refers (also) to the tip of Dumuzi’s penis, where his ‘fruits’ come from.

5-8. It is not clear to me what the **-e** after **lal₃** is in these lines. The spelling of the first person pronoun varies in the manuscripts between ĜA₂.A and ĜA₂.E.

6\. I reconstruct **diĝer-ĝu₁₀** based on the line in manuscript C which Sefati reads as line 5 (Sefati 1998, 165), which has a different second half than line 6 of manuscript A, but such a mistake is not too unexpected.

10\. Here, **buluĝ₅** (which I can’t make out on the copy) would be a spelling variant of **buluĝ₃**. The ‘swollen arm’ would be another metafor for Dumuzi’s penis. The reading of RU as **šub** is uncertain.
